# Game-Dev-Tool-Kits

## Introduction
Game Dev Tool Kits is a curated collection of modular, reusable, and production-ready Unity tools and game mechanic scripts designed to accelerate your development workflow.

This repository is split into two main categories:

- Custom Attributes
	A toolkit of Unity editor extensions using custom attributes to enhance the Inspector experience. These attributes make managing serialized variables easier, more intuitive, and visually organized â€” enabling better debugging and cleaner workflows in the Unity Editor.

- Game Mechanics
	A collection of foundational MonoBehaviour-based scripts representing core gameplay systems. Each mechanic is designed as a base class that can be inherited and extended, making it easy to integrate or customize for your specific project needs. These scripts promote clean architecture and code reuse across different projects.

This toolkit provides a solid starting point that emphasizes scalability, clarity, and real-world usability.
